* Abstraction
   noun
   1. *the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.*
   2. *freedom from representational qualities in art.*

   (Google)

** Abstraction (Software Engineering)

   In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is a
   technique for arranging complexity of computer systems. It works by
   establishing a level of complexity on which a person interacts with
   the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current
   level.

   (Wikipedia)

* Some abstractions
** Terminal

   Cool interfaces took a while to come up because cool monitors took
   a while to come up. Terminals were the main output of computers for
   a while.

*** Terminals are also an abstraction

    It used to be slightly less practical to interact with computers.

*** Shell

    Software that receives commands typed on a keyboard, executes them
    and then prints out the results on a terminal device.

** Some shell commands

   * *ls*: List files in current directory
   * *pwd*: Print out current directory
   * *cd*: Change Directory
   * *cat*: Print out contents of a giv     
    
* More abstractions

** File System
*** Directory
    * Path
    * Files

*** Root Directory
     */*

*** User Directory
     *~*

*** File
    * Path
    * Contents

*** Write Text to Files

    * *touch*
    * *echo*
    * *>*

*** File Attributes
    * Size
    * Creation Date
    * Owner
    * Group
    * Permissions
      - read
      - write
      - execute

*** Configure Permissions

    *chmod*
    
*** Content Types
    * Extensions
    * Magic Number
    * #!

* OMG wait!

** *#!*
   #!/bin/sh\\
   echo "hi"
** *chmod*
   *chmod +x prog*\\
   *ls -l program*\\
   ./prog
